<h3 class="fw-black fst-italic mb-4">Terms & Conditions</h3>
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">1. Thank you for Supporting Bored Mummy Waking Up</h6>
<p>
Bored Mummy Waking Up is an NFT trait-generative project powered by the Ethereum blockchain and started by a group of friends who are developers and
artists at heart. We genuinely appreciate your support of our project and are humbled that you are here. Bored Mummy Waking Up(“BMWU”)
is owned and operated by Denizens.Co. All rights that are not specifically granted to the users and owners of BMWU NFTs are reserved by the Company.
This includes but is not limited to the intellectual property rights surrounding the “Bored Mummy Waking Up” and “BMWU” names, logos, trademarks,
the website, the look and feel of the user interface, the smart contract code, the generative traits in general. In addition to owning the IP
surrounding the name “Bored Mummy Waking Up” and “BMWU”, we reserve the exclusive right to use Bored Mummy Waking Up official logos for future
merchandising purposes.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">2. You Own Your Bored MUMMY</h6>
<p>
The initial product launch of BMWU is a run of 8,888 individual ERC-721 tokens (“Bored Mummy” or “NFTs”) with generative traits that correspond to pieces of art hosted on IPFS.
By connecting your ethereum wallet and minting a Bored Mummy with our smart contract, you gain full and complete ownership of your NFT.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">3. You Own Exclusive Commercial Rights to Your Bored Mummy</h6>
<p>
You will own full commercial rights to your BMWU NFT so long as you continue to own and control the NFT. You may assign some of these rights to other
commercial projects (e.g. Punks Comics, Boring Coffee Company), but any future transfer of your NFT will be subject to those rights that you have
already assigned. You can put your Bored Mummy on clothing and merchandise, include them in video games and video projects, and generally do
whatever you want with your Bored Mummy. You cannot use the name “Bored Mummy Waking Up” on any commercial product, or use “BMWU” unless connected
directly to a “#” and the number of your Bored Mummy signifying the NFT you own. You agree not to use your Bored Mummy in any project or derivative
work that involves hate speech, racism, pornography, or any other illegal content.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">4. You Can Make Derivative Works</h6>
<p>
We want you to feel empowered to create new projects and uses for your Bored Mummy. To give you the greatest amount of flexibility possible,
we intend upon launch to give you access name your own Bored Mummy. You have the right to make derivative works of your Bored Mummy so long
as you own the NFT at the time of creation. Additionally, you may assign those rights to other artists, creatives, or third-party projects so
long as you own the Bored Mummy at the time you grant such permissive use.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">5. Many Third Party Uses Are Not Restricted</h6>
<p>
Nothing in these terms are meant to limit you or a third party from (i) owning or operating an NFT marketplace that permits the use or sale
of the Bored Mummy, so long as the marketplace cryptographically verifies the ownership of the NFT to ensure that only the owner can use and
display their Bored Mummy; and (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion or involvement of the
Bored Mummy generally, provided that the website or application verifies the ownership of the NFT to ensure that only the owner can use and
display their Bored Mummy. Furthermore, nothing in this TOS is meant to restrict a third party website’s ability to build tools which track
traits or sales.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">6. No Guarantees or Future Promises</h6>
<p>
BMWU hopes to continue to develop this project and community. We have released a roadmap outlining some of the future goals we hope to accomplish.
While we intend to work towards those goals, sometimes things happen and we cannot guarantee that this original project will sell out entirely nor
can we guarantee future developments. You agree that your purchase of a Bored Mummy from our initial project is all you are guaranteed to receive
with your initial purchase. Any future potential airdrops, community gatherings, or other benefits are ancillary to this purchase and not to be
taken into consideration with your initial purchase. You agree that you are not relying on any future commitments by BMWU in using this site and
participating in our NFT launch.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">7. BMWU Are Not Intended as Investments</h6>
<p>
Bored Mummy Waking Up NFTs are meant to be a fun avatar and Non-Fungible Token for you to collect.
 They are not meant as investment vehicles. We make absolutely no promise or guarantee that these NFTs will be worth anything.
You understand that they have no inherent monetary value, and they should be treated as nothing more than a fun and beautiful collectible.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">8. Taxes</h6>
<p>
You are entirely responsible for any tax liability which may arise from minting or reselling your Bored Mummy.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">9. Class Action Waiver</h6>
<p>
You agree to waive any class action status, and any legal dispute around the BMWU project which you may choose to bring can only be
done on an individual basis.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">10. Children</h6>
<p>
The BMWU project is not targeted towards children. You agree that you are over the age of 18, or above the legal age of your jurisdiction,
whichever is greater.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">11. Privacy Policy</h6>
<p>
BMWU is not currently collecting any cookies, IP addresses, or user data in connection with your use of the website and app.
You understand, however, that the Ethereum blockchain network is a public blockchain, and all of your transaction history initiated through
the website will be made public. You also understand that BMWU may work with third-party apps, such as Discord or Collab.Land, which collect
and store user data. In the future, BMWU will likely launch products (e.g. merch store) which require us to collect and store user data.
In that event, this provision is subject to change.
</p>
<hr class="my-3" />
<h6 class="fw-black fst-italic">12. Happy Summoning!</h6>
<p>
Bored Mummy Waking Up will succeed only with the support of you and the other members of our community. We appreciate you, and sincerely thank you for being a part of our launch.
See you on Discord and happy summoning!
